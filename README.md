# Libft 
## Overview
A personal C library implementation of commonly used functions, built from scratch as the foundational project of the 42 School curriculum.

## Functions
The Libft library includes a wide range of functions, organized into several categories. Some of the key categories include:

### Memory Functions
- ft_memset: Sets a block of memory to a specific value.
- ft_bzero: Clears a block of memory to zero.
- ft_memcpy: Copies a block of memory from one location to another.
- ft_memccpy: Copies a block of memory from one location to another, stopping when a specific character is encountered.
- ft_memmove: Copies a block of memory from one location to another, handling overlapping memory correctly.

### String Functions
- ft_strlen: Returns the length of a string.
- ft_strcpy: Copies a string from one location to another.
- ft_strncpy: Copies a string from one location to another, with a specified length.
- ft_strdup: Duplicates a string.
- ft_strcat: Concatenates two strings.
- ft_strncat: Concatenates two strings, with a specified length.

### Character Functions
- ft_isalpha: Determines whether a character is a letter.
- ft_isdigit: Determines whether a character is a digit.
- ft_isalnum: Determines whether a character is alphanumeric.
- ft_isascii: Determines whether a character is an ASCII character.
- ft_isprint: Determines whether a character is printable.

## Usage
To use the Libft library in your own projects, you need to first compile it into a library file. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the make command. This will compile the library and generate a libft.a file.
