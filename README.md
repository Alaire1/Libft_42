# Libft 
## Overwiev
The Libft project is a collection of useful C functions that you can use in your own projects. This library was created as part of the curriculum for the 42 coding school, and is used extensively in many of their subsequent projects.

## Functions
The Libft library includes a wide range of functions, organized into several categories. Some of the key categories include:

### Memory Functions
- ft_memset: Sets a block of memory to a specific value.
- ft_bzero: Clears a block of memory to zero.
- ft_memcpy: Copies a block of memory from one location to another.
- ft_memccpy: Copies a block of memory from one location to another, stopping when a specific character is encountered.
- ft_memmove: Copies a block of memory from one location to another, handling overlapping memory correctly.

### String Functions
- ft_strlen: Returns the length of a string.
- ft_strcpy: Copies a string from one location to another.
- ft_strncpy: Copies a string from one location to another, with a specified length.
- ft_strdup: Duplicates a string.
- ft_strcat: Concatenates two strings.
- ft_strncat: Concatenates two strings, with a specified length.

### Character Functions
- ft_isalpha: Determines whether a character is a letter.
- ft_isdigit: Determines whether a character is a digit.
- ft_isalnum: Determines whether a character is alphanumeric.
- ft_isascii: Determines whether a character is an ASCII character.
- ft_isprint: Determines whether a character is printable.

## Usage
To use the Libft library in your own projects, you need to first compile it into a library file. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the make command. This will compile the library and generate a libft.a file.
